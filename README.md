## What is Plandora?
Have you ever forgotten the birthday of a good friend or even a family member? Unpleasant situation, right? Our vision is to prevent you from having this experience!
Plandora, our Android app, helps you remember annual or one-time events and even assists you collecting great ideas for a gift or discussing them with friends.
There wonâ€™t be any missed birthdays, any disappointment or guilty feelings!
